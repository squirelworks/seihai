//! Combat, the way the 2.05 client runs it: the victim's client judges.
//!
//! Sources: `decomp-findings-2026-10-24/04-sword-hitbox.md` (who decides a
//! sword hit and the reach rule), `01-death-respawn.md` (hurt state, claim),
//! `constants-205.tsv`, and Graal_analysis `protocol/packet-layouts.md`
//! "Hits" and `02-weapons-combat.md` (the ids and layouts of 26/40 and
//! 36/46). The numbers come from the version profile's [`CombatRules`];
//! nothing here names a version. A build without a row judges no hits and
//! sends none. `documentation/combat.md` lists what is not known.
//!
//! How a sword hit happens: the attacker does not send "I hit you". Its
//! client broadcasts its position, direction and sprite as it swings (the
//! sprite is `dir + 4 * S` with S 6 to 10 while the sword is out), and every
//! other client tests whether *it* is in the box in front of that swing.
//! [`judge_sword`] is that test, run on the receiving side. Packet hits
//! (`PLO_HURTPLAYER` 40, `PLO_HITOBJECTS` 46) carry their own power and are
//! judged by [`judge_hurtplayer`].
