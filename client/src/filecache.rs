//! File-transfer caching rules.
//!
//! What the real clients keep, what they ask the server for, and where a
//! download is saved. Read from the 2.05 rev 2, 2.17.1, 2.22 and 2.31
//! clients and checked against the lab captures of 2.17, 2.22 and 2.31
//! (2026-10-24). `documentation/file-cache.md` has the table of rules and
//! what is still open.
//!
//! The pieces:
//!
//! * [`FileRequester`]: the three name lists a client keeps. It decides
//!   between `PLI_WANTFILE` (23, no local copy), `PLI_UPDATEFILE` (34, a
//!   local copy whose mod time the server may know better) and nothing, and
//!   it keeps at most four requests of each kind on the wire.
//! * [`download_dir`]: the folder a downloaded file goes to.
//! * [`DownloadStore`]: saves a `PLO_FILE` the way the clients do (in place
//!   when the client already has the file, else in the folder for its
//!   kind), sets the file's time to the server's mod time, and keeps the
//!   bytes in memory when saving to disk is off.
//! * [`FileSession`]: the three together, for the client binary.
