//! Pose animations of the player: the sword swing, the hurt pose, sitting
//! (item 22), and the idle, walking and swimming figure.
//!
//! The poses here are *driven by state that already exists* rather than by a
//! clock of their own, so what is drawn can never disagree with what the
//! other players are sent:
//!
//! Every step of a GANI is held for `1 + WAIT` ticks of 50 ms, as the real
//! 2.05 client holds it (Graal_analysis `player-mannerisms-live.md`, read
//! live: push 4 ticks a frame, pull 2, hurt 31, lift 6, swim 2). A file
//! without `WAIT` lines steps once a tick.
//!
//! * **Walk** shows the frame `offline` has stepped to: one GANI frame per
//!   step taken (every 50 ms), the same stepping that plays the footstep
//!   cues. **Swim** runs on the tick clock instead ([`OfflineSession::tick_poses`]):
//!   the real client keeps the stroke going while the player floats still.
//!   **Idle** shows `idle.gani`'s first step when the player is not walking.
//!   The sprite value the other players are sent is not touched.
//! * **Sword** follows the swing of [`crate::combat::CombatState`]: swing
//!   step `i` (the sprite value S = 6 + `i` that goes on the wire) shows step
//!   `i` of `sword.gani`. A GANI `PLAYSOUND` cue after a step is queued as a
//!   sound event when that step is entered, so `sword.wav` plays at the start
//!   of the swing. When the swing ends the pose is gone and the player is
//!   drawn as idle again, which is what the file's `SETBACKTO idle` says.
//! * **Hurt** follows hurt mode. The 2.05 client sets the `hurt` gani when
//!   hurt mode starts (Graal_analysis 01-death-respawn). A `LOOP` file
//!   repeats for the whole hurt mode; any other plays once by its waits (the
//!   stock file: 31 ticks) and gives way to idle. The sprite others see
//!   (S = 32) lasts the whole of hurt mode and is not changed here.
//! * **Dead** shows `dead.gani` while the player is dead, one step per tick
//!   of the death timer by its waits, held on its last step. The 2.05 client plays the
//!   local `dead` gani on death. Seihai's default set has its own: the hurt
//!   pose, kneeling, then lying on the back.
//! * **Push**, **grab** and **pull** follow [`crate::offline::PushPull`]:
//!   the push pose on the 18th blocked step in a row (`push.gani` from its
//!   first step there, restarting each time the count wraps from 38 to 18),
//!   the grab pose while A holds a wall, and the pull pose (`pull.gani`,
//!   looping) from the arrow away from the wall on. Once started the pull
//!   pose stays, letting go of the arrow and of A, until the player moves:
//!   the 2.05 client sets nothing else then. The 2.05 client plays its
//!   `push`, `grab` and `pull` ganis then. Before the push pose (and before a ledge jump) the walk
//!   pose keeps stepping while the arrow is held: 2.05 sets the walk gani
//!   on every walk tick whether the step moved or not, so the player runs in
//!   place against the wall. A ledge jump keeps the walk pose: 2.05 plays no
//!   other gani in the air.
//! * **Lift** shows `lift.gani` once when an object is picked up (the stock
//!   file: 6 ticks), then the carry poses.
//! * **Hidden** under a carried object (D): `hiddenstill` / `hidden` on
//!   builds that play them (2.05 on), else the carry poses go on (see
//!   `offline/hide.rs`).
//! * **Sit** is shown while [`OfflineSession::sitting`] is set and the player
//!   is not walking. The session sets it when the feet are on a chair tile
//!   (arrays.dat array 4, tile type 3: benches, chairs, couches). How the
//!   real client starts the sit pose was not read; this trigger is inferred
//!   (see `documentation/sitting.md`).
//!
//! A pose is shown only when its GANI is loaded (`OfflineSession::poses`),
//! so a build without GANIs, or a data folder without `sword.gani`, draws the
//! plain idle figure as before.
