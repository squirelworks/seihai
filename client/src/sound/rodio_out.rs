//! Device backend on `rodio` (feature `audio-rodio`).
//!
//! The output stream lives on its own thread and is told what to do over
//! a channel. On Windows the launcher's window (winit, with drag and drop)
//! makes the main thread a single-threaded COM apartment, and a WASAPI
//! stream opened there stays silent: the device opens but nothing is heard
//! (seen on Windows, 2026-10-30).
//! A thread of our own starts with no COM apartment, so `cpal` sets up the
//! one it needs. (`OutputStream` is not `Send` either, so it has to stay on
//! the thread that made it.)
